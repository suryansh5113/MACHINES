# Diabetes Progression Prediction using Linear Regression 🧠📈

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict diabetes progression one year after baseline based on real medical measurements, using Multiple Linear Regression.

---

## 📚 Project Details

- Dataset: Real-world medical data from scikit-learn's `load_diabetes()`
- Input Features:
  - age
  - sex
  - bmi
  - blood pressure (bp)
  - and 6 more blood serum measurements
- Target:
  - Disease progression score after 1 year

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

- Imported and explored real-world dataset
- Defined input features (X) and target variable (y)
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Predicted diabetes progression scores
- Evaluated model performance using R² Score
- Visualized actual vs predicted results using a scatter plot

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn (load_diabetes, LinearRegression)

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- Achieved an R² Score of ~0.51 on training data
