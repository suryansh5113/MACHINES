# Multiple Linear Regression: Predict Weight from Height and Age ğŸ§ ğŸ“Š

This project builds a simple Machine Learning model to predict a person's weight based on their height and age using Multiple Linear Regression.

---

## Features
- Two input features: Height (cm) and Age (years)
- Output: Predicted Weight (kg)
- Data is randomly generated for simulation
- Model is evaluated using RÂ² Score
- Visualization of actual vs predicted weights in 3D space

---

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository (MACHINES) locally.
2. Open the `simple_linear_regression/linear_regression.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run all cells sequentially.

You will see:
- Model training
- RÂ² Score printed
- 3D Scatter Plot of Actual vs Predicted Weights

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn (LinearRegression)
